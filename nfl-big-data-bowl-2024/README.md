# NFL BIG DATA BOWL 2024
## Tackling
> Create metrics that assign value to elements of tackling
> Generate actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data corresponding to tackling. 

- Predictions of tackle time, probability, and/or location
- Tackle range: angle of pursuit, speed and acceleration, closing speed
- Player evaluation (e.g, yards saved, tackle value, missed tackles)
- Credit assignment (e.g, one player makes a tackle because of another players, blocks shed, area of influence)
- Tackle type (solo vs gang, open field vs in the trenches, etc)
- Team and player roles and responsibilities (setting the edge, filling gaps, etc)
